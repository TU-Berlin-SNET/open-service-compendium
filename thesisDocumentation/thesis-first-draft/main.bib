	abstract = {Cloud computing has recently emerged as a new paradigm for hosting and delivering services over the Internet. Cloud computing is attractive to business owners as it eliminates the requirement for users to plan ahead for provisioning, and allows enterprises to start from the small and increase resources only when there is a rise in service demand. However, despite the fact that cloud computing offers huge opportunities to the IT industry, the development of cloud computing technology is currently at its infancy, with many issues still to be addressed. In this paper, we present a survey of cloud computing, highlighting its key concepts, architectural principles, state-of-the-art implementation as well as research challenges. The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the design challenges of cloud computing and identify important research directions in this increasingly important area.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a highly discussed topic in the technical and economic world, and many of the big players of the software industry have entered the development of cloud services. Several companies what to explore the possibilities and benefits of incorporating such cloud computing services in their business, as well as the possibilities to offer own cloud services. However, with the amount of cloud computing services increasing quickly, the need for a taxonomy framework rises. This paper examines the available cloud computing services and identifies and explains their main characteristics. Next, this paper organizes these characteristics and proposes a tree-structured taxonomy. This taxonomy allows quick classifications of the different cloud computing services and makes it easier to compare them. Based on existing taxonomies, this taxonomy provides more detailed characteristics and hierarchies. Additionally, the taxonomy offers a common terminology and baseline information for easy communication. Finally, the taxonomy is explained and verified using existing cloud services as examples.},

	abstract = {Networked humans and autonomous systems rely increasingly on service-oriented architectures. Conventional systems often focus on digitally delivered web services or on business services with varying degrees of formal- isation. According to service integration principles, the service registry as the pivotal point between providers and consumers determines the types of services which can be found and delivered. With the growing impor- tance of cloud computing topics in research and industry, more generic service models, description languages and registry architectures are proposed to extend the breadth towards truly reusable Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) registration entries. Despite the proposals, there is a shortage of capable and extensible XaaS registries. In this paper, we present such a system and share our experience in using it for service-related experiments.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has already been adopted in a broad range of application domains. However, domains like the distributed development of embedded systems are still unable to benefit from the advancements of cloud computing. Besides general security concerns, a common obstacle often is the incompatibility between such applications and the cloud. In particular, if applications need direct access to hardware elements, cloud computing cannot be used. In this paper we describe an approach of a novel cloud layer called Hardware as a Service (HaaS), which allows for usage distinct hardware components through the Internet analogously to the cloud services. HaaS focuses the transparent integration of remote hardware that is distributed over multiple geographical locations into an operating system. Furthermore, HaaS will not only enable interconnection of physical systems, but also virtual hardware emulation. Therefore, we consider in this paper only the use of emulated hardware and the interconnection with hardware models. To demonstrate the tremendous improvement by a Haas cloud, we explain the applicability in a distributed development process by an anti blocking system and an adaptive cruise control system in the automotive industry.},
